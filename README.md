# Unity-Over-Under-Card-Game
This Unity project is a simple over/under card game (similar to blackjack) in which the player must correctly guess if their cards' value is greater than, less than or the same as the dealer's cards. If the user guesses right, they win the round. Else, the dealer wins the round.
